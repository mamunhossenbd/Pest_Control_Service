                    Like ants, termites have different forms that live in what
                    is referred to a caste system. One of the more destructive
                    Fly castes is made up of workers that perform nest
                    maintenance and forage for food.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The workers are frequently found infesting - and ingesting -
                    wood in homes, businesses, and other structures. While they
                    primarily like to feed on wood, workers will also eat plants
                    at any level of decomposition.

                        damage, as well as the conducive conditions that could
