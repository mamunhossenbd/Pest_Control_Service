                        <p>
                            The first step in industrial pest control is a thorough inspection of the premises. This involves identifying potential pest entry points, identifying any existing infestations, and assessing the extent of the problem. Once the inspection is complete, the pest control company will develop a treatment plan based on the findings.

                            Industrial pest control treatments typically involve the use of chemical or non-chemical methods. Chemical treatments may include the use of insecticides, rodenticides, and other pest control products. Non-chemical methods may include the use of traps, baits, and exclusion techniques to prevent pests from entering the premises.
